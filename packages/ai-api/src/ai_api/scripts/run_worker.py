"""
arq worker entry point.

This script starts the arq worker process that consumes jobs
from the Redis queue and processes them asynchronously.

Usage:
    # Development
    python -m ai_api.scripts.run_worker

    # Production (from package root)
    uv run python -m ai_api.scripts.run_worker

The worker will:
1. Connect to Redis using settings from environment variables
2. Listen for jobs on the queue
3. Process chat jobs by streaming from Pydantic AI agent
4. Save results to PostgreSQL and Redis
5. Gracefully handle shutdown signals (SIGINT, SIGTERM)
